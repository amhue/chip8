![Screenshot of emulator in usage](./assets/playing.png)

This is a simple CHIP-8 emulator in C.
Roms can be opened both by dragging the file over the window
and dropping it, as well as, using the command line as:

``` bash
$ chip8 romfile.ch8
```

Support for more command line options and sound will be later on.

## Compatibility:

The program should compile on Windows and Linux. However it has been tested only on Windows so far. As such the release for Linux shall be released later.
