# Chip 8 Emulator

![Screenshot of emulator in usage](./assets/playing.png)

This is a simple chip 8 emulator in C.
Roms can be opened both by dragging the file over the window
and dropping it, as well as, using the command line as:

``` bash
$ chip8 romfile.ch8
```

Support for more command line options and sound will be later on.
